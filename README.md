Hello! I am Abilash Vanam. This is my first project uploaded on Github. The goal of this project is to Detect the diseases in plants. The dataset is taken from Kaggle.
The dataset consists of about 87K rgb images of healthy and diseased crop leaves which is categorized into 38 different classes. I used the following Convolutional Neural Networks to predict the accuracy of the model.
a) Baseline Neural Network
b) Adding Dense Layer with Relu activation and drop out
c) Data Augmentation
d) DenseNet 121
e) ResNet 152
f) Inception V3
g) MobileNet v2
h) Xception
i) Efficient Net
j) Inception Resnet V2
